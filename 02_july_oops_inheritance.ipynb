    "1. What is Inheritance in OOP and Why It is Used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental OOP concept that allows one class (the derived or child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (the base or parent class). It promotes code reuse, reduces redundancy, and enhances maintainability by enabling a hierarchical class structure. This way, common functionality can be defined in a base class, while specific behavior can be implemented in derived classes."

    "2. Discuss the concept of single inheritance and multiple inheritance, highlighting their differences and advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    " Single Inheritance vs. Multiple Inheritance\n",
    " \n",
    "Single Inheritance: Involves a derived class inheriting from one base class. This simplifies the class hierarchy and reduces complexity.\n",
    "Advantages: Easier to understand, less ambiguity, and simpler code maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance: Involves a derived class inheriting from more than one base class.\n",
    "Advantages: Greater flexibility and the ability to combine functionalities from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "Single inheritance is straightforward and avoids potential issues with method resolution. Multiple inheritance can introduce complexity, especially if two base classes define a method with the same name (known as the Diamond Problem)."
